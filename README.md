This article unravels the opportunities and limits for generating new academic knowledge about the use of time in borderlands through interviews conducted and produced by citizen scientists. We narrate the experiences of a citizen scientist throughout an interdisciplinary experiment in which citizen scientists and border scholars expressed their thoughts about the meaning of borders. Analysing citizen scientist Termime’s (pseudonym) oral and written expressions as a case study with the help of Achim Landwehr’s concept of *Chronoreferenzen* (chronoreferencing), we decipher the intricate links citizen scientists identify between the past, the present and the future in the way they see borders within the three different genres practised during the experiment: a monologue, a dialogue and a digital café. 

At the same time, the article also presents a reflection on the digital research process applied during the study. The hermeneutic layer evaluates the methods and tools we used throughout the workflow, from organising the experiment to analysing the data and presenting the findings in the *Journal of Digital History* with respect to the three well-known stages in digital hermeneutical research: digital source criticism, tool criticism and visualisation criticism. Adding ‘output criticism’ as a fourth step enables us to present our reflection on the presentation possibilities and constraints of digital publishing and propose changes.
